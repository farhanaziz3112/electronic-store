# electronic-store

E-commerce site for a electronic store, which include three main system, Customer, Admin and API. It was just a self-practice during my free time. It is still not complete yet at the moment, but I will try to finish it all when there is free time.

The tech stack for this project is:
1. Angular: Framework used for both customer and admin website
2. PrimeNG and PrimeFlex: UI Library used for the frontend part
3. NestJS: Used to build the RESTful API
4. MongoDB: Database used to store our data

These are some screenshots for the customer site:
